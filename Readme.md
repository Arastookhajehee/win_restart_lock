# Scripts to prevent windows to restart by itself

Windows 11 does not allow us to stop automatic restarts after update installs.
the scripts will stop/allow Windows from automatically restarting when users are logged on after updates

## Important points

- The scripts only work for logged in users.
- Updates will still install but windows will not restart

** Please use this scripts at your own risk. The author of this repo and the video bare no responsibility if things go wrong **
